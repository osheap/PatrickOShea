                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>As an early-career geospatial professional with a domain specialization in the water sciences, I leverage my training and experience to drive innovative solutions for water resource engineering and management problems. Over the past four years, I've applied my expertise in spatial data analysis, geospatial problem-solving, and water resources engineering to deliver successful outcomes for my clients.</p>
                <p>I hold multiple advanced degrees, including a Master’s in Hydrology from the Colorado School of Mines, A Master's in Earth Sciences from Scripps Intitution of Oceanography, and a Bachelors of Science from the University of Miami, where I majored in both geology and geography as well as obtained a gis certification.  I have recently furthered my knowledge with specialized coursework in GIS programming and web application development while obtaining a Master’s in Spatial Data Science from Penn State.</p>
                <p>My career began with roles focusing on hydrologic analysis and geospatial data integration. These roles include working as a Student hydrologist in the U.S. Geological Survey where I supported water focused science initiatives throughout Colorado, as well as several water resources engineering positions at companies like Galloway & Company, Inc., and Hazen and Sawyer, where I used my skills to develop GIS standard operating procedures and produced detailed hydrologic and hydraulic models.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I’ve both returned to the USGS as a student contractor and have been contributing as a web developer within the Web Informatics and Mapping Group, as well as participated as a NASA DEVELOP intern while completing my degree program.</p>

                <h2>Career Objectives</h2>
                <p><b>Grow</b> - Both in a technical and professional sense, I wish to continue growing into a better spatial data scientist and water resources specialist. I want to further distinguish myself as a technical expert by growing my proficiencies in several coding languages, GIS platforms, web development frameworks, and hydrologic/hydraulic modeling software. Moreover, I want to further develop as a professional by further networking within my field, developing more products, and furthering my abilities to communicate meaningful scientific findings to shareholders and the public at large.</p>
                <p><b>Serve</b> - Given that service is a guiding principle that I hold for my career development, I wish to work in a role that leverages my skills to serve my community. I am open to working at organizations that share this spirit of service and has a proven track record for using spatial data sciences to help tackle pressing environmental and natural resources management issues. </p>
                <p><b>Lead</b> - As I continue to gain new skills and have more opportunities to serve, I ultimately am striving for a leadership role where I can help guide an organization and perform projects that lead to a more sustainable future.
